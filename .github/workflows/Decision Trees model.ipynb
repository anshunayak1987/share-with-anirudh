So if we use the same input, we'll get the same decision tree each time. (And, we won't get a different answer after aggregating.) To get different trees, we give them different inputs by randomly sampling the input dataset. Random sampling with replacement is known as bootstrapping. (We use replacement because a data point might occur multiple times in the random sample.) This method of creating a random ensemble is known as bootstrap aggregating, or bagging."
